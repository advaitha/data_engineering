# Introduction
* Document can consist of sub-documents or array of sub-documents
* We can have an index for a field in the document
* Partitions by key  
* Sharding - Distribute the partition into different shards
* collections - They are like buckets
* We need to manually set the index in MongoDB
  
## Schema Design
* We need to be aware of how will be querying the data before going for a schema design
   

## Tools
* pymongo is a package to interact with MongoDB using Python
* Mango Express - web UI
