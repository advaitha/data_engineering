## How Kafka Works
* Topics - We can setup many topics
  * Partitions 
  * In sync replicas - For redundancy
* Messages
  * Key
  * Message
  * Max size - Ideally smaller messages
  * Messages will be in binary format
* Brokers

* Producers
  * Sending the messages to the brokers
* Consumers and Consumer groups
  * Consume the data from the brokers
